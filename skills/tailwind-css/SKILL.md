- Master utility classes for layout, typography, colors, and effects
- Configure and customize Tailwind for your design system
- Implement responsive design patterns efficiently
- Optimize build processes and purge unused styles
- Create custom components and design tokens
- Integrate with component libraries and frameworks

## When to use me

Load this skill when you're:
- Building projects with Tailwind CSS
- Need to research utility classes or configuration options
- Setting up Tailwind in a new project or framework
- Creating custom themes or design systems
- Optimizing Tailwind builds for production
- Troubleshooting styling issues or responsive behavior

## How I work

I use the Context7 MCP to fetch the latest documentation and examples from Tailwind CSS. This ensures you always get current information about:

- Complete utility class reference

- Typography (Font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
- Colors (Palette, opacity, gradients)
- Borders and effects (Shadows, transforms, filters)
- Responsive design (Breakpoints, mobile-first approach)

### Advanced Features
- Custom property integration (CSS variables)
- Dark mode implementation
- Animation and transition utilities
- Container queries and modern CSS features
- Plugin development and customization

### Configuration & Setup
- Tailwind config file optimization
- Content purging and JIT compilation
- Framework integration (React, Vue, Svelte, Next.js)
- Build tool configuration (Vite, Webpack, PostCSS)
- Design token management

### Performance & Optimization
- Bundle size optimization
- Critical CSS extraction
- Unused style purging
- Production build strategies

## Usage Instructions

When you load this skill, I will:

1. **Research First**: Use `context7_resolve-library-id` to find the correct Tailwind CSS library ID
2. **Query Documentation**: Use `context7_query-docs` to fetch relevant information based on your specific needs
3. **Provide Context**: Give you current, accurate information about utilities, configuration, and best practices
4. **Generate Examples**: Create implementation examples based on the latest documentation

## Example Queries I Can Help With

- "How do I set up Tailwind CSS with Next.js and TypeScript?"
- "What are the best utility classes for creating a responsive card layout?"
- "How do I customize the color palette and add custom design tokens?"
- "Show me how to implement dark mode with Tailwind CSS"
- "What's the most efficient way to create reusable component styles?"
- "How do I optimize Tailwind CSS for production builds?"

## Design System Integration

I excel at helping you:
- Create consistent spacing and typography scales
- Implement brand colors and design tokens
- Build reusable component patterns
- Maintain design system documentation
- Ensure accessibility compliance with utility classes

## Framework-Specific Patterns

I provide guidance for:
- **React**: Conditional classes, component styling patterns
- **Vue**: Class binding and scoped styles integration
- **Svelte**: Style directives and component composition
- **Next.js**: SSR considerations and optimization
- **Astro**: Component styling and build optimization

## Integration Notes

This skill works best when combined with:
- `shadcn-ui` skill for component library styling
- `atomic-design` skill for component architecture
- `typescript-advanced-types` skill for type-safe styling
- Framework-specific skills for optimal integration

Always use Context7 to get the most current information about utilities, configuration options, and best practices rather than relying on potentially outdated knowledge.
