## What I do

I provide up-to-date knowledge and implementation guidance for Shadcn/UI, a modern React component library. I help you:

- Find and implement the right components for your use case
- Understand component APIs, props, and customization options
- Set up and configure Shadcn/UI in your project
- Follow best practices for component composition and theming
- Integrate with Tailwind CSS and design tokens

## When to use me

Load this skill when you're:
- Building React applications with Shadcn/UI components
- Need to research component APIs or implementation patterns
- Setting up a new project with Shadcn/UI
- Customizing or extending Shadcn/UI components
- Troubleshooting component behavior or styling issues

## How I work

I use the Context7 MCP to fetch the latest documentation and examples from Shadcn/UI. This ensures you always get current information about:

- Component installation and setup
- API documentation and prop interfaces
- Usage examples and code snippets
- Theming and customization guides
- Integration patterns with other libraries

## Key Areas of Expertise

### Component Library
- Form components (Input, Select, Checkbox, etc.)
- Navigation (Tabs, Breadcrumb, Pagination)
- Feedback (Alert, Toast, Dialog, Sheet)
- Data display (Table, Card, Badge, Avatar)
- Layout components (Separator, Aspect Ratio)

### Setup & Configuration
- CLI installation and component addition
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- TypeScript integration
- Theme customization with CSS variables
- Dark mode implementation

### Best Practices
- Component composition patterns
- Accessibility considerations
- Performance optimization
- Testing strategies
- Design system integration

## Usage Instructions

When you load this skill, I will:

1. **Research First**: Use `context7_resolve-library-id` to find the correct Shadcn/UI library ID
2. **Query Documentation**: Use `context7_query-docs` to fetch relevant information based on your specific needs
3. **Provide Context**: Give you current, accurate information about components, setup, and best practices
4. **Generate Code**: Create implementation examples based on the latest documentation

## Example Queries I Can Help With

- "How do I set up Shadcn/UI in a new Next.js project?"
- "Show me how to create a form with validation using Shadcn/UI components"
- "What are the props for the Dialog component and how do I customize its styling?"
- "How do I implement a data table with sorting and filtering?"
- "What's the best way to theme Shadcn/UI components for a custom design system?"

## Integration Notes

This skill works best when combined with:
- `tailwind-css` skill for advanced styling
- `typescript-advanced-types` skill for complex type definitions
- `atomic-design` skill for component architecture
- `nextjs-patterns` skill for Next.js integration

Always use Context7 to get the most current information rather than relying on potentially outdated knowledge.
